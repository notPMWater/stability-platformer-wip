# stability-platformer-wip
Work in progress game. Enjoy!

Controls:
- A/D: Left/Right movement
- W: Jump
- S: Fast-fall

How to play:
- Get across the platforms, avoid spikes, kill enemies, and reach checkpoints!
- Enemies can be killed when the player touches the enemy while in fast-fall mode.

This is an unfinished game. I will be adding:
- Player, enemy, and checkpoint textures.
- Expanded levels and even more levels.
- WAY wilder combat mechanics!
- A crap ton of animations.

Please playtest the game and notify me of bugs and anything you would like me to add!
